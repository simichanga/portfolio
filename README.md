Welcome to my developer portfolio! This project showcases my skills as an aspiring software engineer, built with the power of Next.js and React. I utilized [Aceternity](https://aceternity.com) for UI components and [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io) to create visually stunning gradients throughout the site.

## 🌟 Features

- **Next.js Framework**: Fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly.
- **React**: Interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: An API for design system
- **Aceternity Components**: Beautiful and reusable UI components.
- **CSS Gradients**: Eye-catching gradients for a modern look.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices.

## 🌈 Gradients

Some gradients I love from [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io):

- **Blue to Purple**: `linear-gradient(90deg, #0070f3 0%, #7928ca 100%)`
- **Green to Blue**: `linear-gradient(90deg, #00e887 0%, #0070f3 100%)`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- **React**: [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- **Tailwind CSS**: [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- **React Components**: Building reusable components.
- **Next.js Features**: Utilizing server-side rendering and API routes.
- **UI Design**: Creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.
- **CSS Techniques**: Implementing gradients and responsive design.

Feel free to explore the project, customize components, and use it as a template for your own portfolio!

#### 🚀 Optimizing Performance

For best performance, ensure you are following Next.js optimization guidelines:

Use static generation with getStaticProps and getStaticPaths when possible.
    Optimize images using the next/image component.
